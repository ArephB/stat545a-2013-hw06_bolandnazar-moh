Labor Force Survey
==================================

Introduction
========================================================

  In this Homework, I tried to work with a new dataset. After my first experience with a dataset about Canadians labor economics in the last homework: [Work on CANSIM tables](http://rpubs.com/aref/stat545a-2013-hw05_bolandnazar-moh) I decided to find a more detailed and complete dataset about what I did in that assignment. I figured out that some of my colleagues have used an interesting similar data: Canadian Labor Force (LFS). This data is mostly about labor force measures such as wages, tenure, occupation, unemployment status, etc. 

  This large data set covers years 1997-2013 and each year about 100000 distinct entries.
