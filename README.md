#### Abstract
========================================================

  In this assginment, I worked on Canadian LFS data from 1997 to 2013. I focused on some of the variables describing the labor force among different provinces, age groups, etc. There were interesting results, such as gender gap in hourly wages and the trend of wage increase among different Provinces. However, the data was too much detailed in categorical aspects of observations, and limited in quantitative measures of the labor force. It was also reflecting a short period of time which makes our suggestions less reliable. 

Another difficulty to deal with data was the frequency weights and the way we used it made some biasedness in the data. However, the results made sense to a good extent which means that we have not lost too much. 

All in all this sort of exercise to clean up a huge data was a good experiencec for me, eventhough it took a lot of time.
